# Documentation

You can find ZenCrepes documentation on [docs.zencrepes.io](https://docs.zencrepes.io/).

This readme only contains developer-focused details.

# Start Developing

ZAPI is a [Nest.js](http://nestjs.com/) app, it is aimed at being used with ZUI.

## Launch the app

```bash
yarn
yarn run start:dev
```

Note: zqueue needs to be able to reach to an Elasticsearch instance

# Reach-out

I'd be more than happy to get feedback and external contributions, just submit a PR with your requested changes. Feel free to reach out on [slack](http://slack.overture.bio/), ZenCrepes has a dedicated channel on `#app_zencrepes`.

Overture gracefully provides the VM instance hosting dev & prod and the slack channel. ZenCrepes is not an Overture project.
